# Leshy2 Hardware — current engineering state

> Snapshot: 2026-08-16. This page describes proven maturity. The intended
> behavior is in the [hardware target README](../../README.md); software behavior
> is in the [firmware target README](https://github.com/anton-vinogradov/esp32-leshy2-firmware/blob/main/README.md).

- Canonical evidence: [review ledger](../review/README.md)
- Russian version: [current-state.ru.md](current-state.ru.md)
- Corrected gate chain: [`FLOW-0001`](../review/architecture/FLOW-0001-product-to-cad-gates.md)

## Review progress

| Gate | State |
|---|---|
| 0. Review baseline | Reviewed |
| 1. Product intent and safety/legal boundaries | Reviewed |
| 2. Capabilities, exclusions, concurrency/failure needs | Reviewed (`REV-0002AD`) |
| 3. Target physical/product design | **Active; output not yet reviewed** |
| 4–6. Whole-device alternatives, optimality and conceptual co-design | Not started in the corrected process |
| 7. Atomic architecture | **Reopened** by `DEC-0032` |
| 8. Components/BOM | Blocked; previous evidence is candidate/reference only |
| 9. Electrical/CAD/firmware architecture | Blocked; no active canonical KiCad implementation |
| 10–11. PCB, fabrication and bring-up | Not started |

The canonical table is [`stages.md`](../review/stages.md).

## What remains reviewed

- all-in-one autonomous field-product intent, non-aggression onboarding and the
  Main/Lab/Controlled-Zone safety model;
- conservative TX defaults, explicit maximum-power choice, hard STOP/no
  automatic re-arm and separate actual-TX evidence;
- the complete 125-leaf wishlist review and no-loss cost rule;
- three full-function nRF24 paths with simultaneous reception;
- ordinary 2.4/5 GHz Wi-Fi, IEEE 802.15.4, native BLE and 2.4 GHz/ESP-NOW
  capability requirements;
- packet Sub-GHz, broadcast receive, analog voice, audio, IR, external
  GNSS/LoRa/NFC and their safety/evidence boundaries;
- open owner-controlled signed updates and the requirement that every selected
  programmable chip retain independent programming/recovery/diagnostics.

These are product inputs. Exact MCU/module ownership, pins, buses, board count,
connectors, parts and enclosure are not accepted.

## Correction completed

[`FND-0039`](../review/findings/FND-0039-architecture-frozen-before-product-design.md)
found that the former architecture chain skipped target physical design,
whole-product optimality and conceptual placement. The owner selected reopen
option A in [`DEC-0032`](../review/decisions/DEC-0032-reopen-product-design-before-cad.md).

Consequences:

- `DEC-0028/PKG-0001/SYN-3A` are historical candidate/reference evidence, not
  the target;
- C5 revision, compute ownership, pin and three-domain service studies are
  conditional candidate facts;
- the previously active C-001…005 KiCad library and CI are archived under
  [`premature-compute-cad-2026-08-16`](../../drafts/premature-compute-cad-2026-08-16/README.md);
- the pre-commit C-006 experiment is recorded as discarded in
  [`premature-service-cad-2026-08-16`](../../drafts/premature-service-cad-2026-08-16/README.md), without claiming a reproducible snapshot;
- active [`hardware/kicad`](../../hardware/kicad/README.md) contains only the
  upstream gate, not symbols, schematic or PCB.

`REV-0004H` reviews this correction. It does not review the new product design.

## Active next artifact

The next artifact starts from reviewed capabilities and defines the physical
product without choosing electronics: form factor/use posture, control and
connector surfaces, display, battery/charging, external-module attachment,
antenna volumes, service access, environment/repairability and target cost.
Only after its owner review will complete architecture alternatives be built.
